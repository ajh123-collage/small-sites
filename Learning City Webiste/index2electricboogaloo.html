  <h1>Salford Learning City</h1>
  <p>What are we about?</p>
  </div>
  <div>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
  <p>Salford City Council, alongside the University of Salford, Salford City College, The Lowry,
   Salford CCG and SRFT Salford CVS, and a range of community groups is developing a
   different style of learning.</p>
   <p>Using our community’s knowledge and expertise, we will turn Salford into a dynamic,
interactive academy of ideas with ‘no strings attached’ educational and developmental
opportunities. It’s all about the joy of learning.</p>
<p>For people who struggle with exams, tests and qualifications, Salford’s Learning City
approach will support those who feel excluded from formal education. At the same time,
the approach will recognise the knowledge and skills in our communities. Learners can also
be teachers.</p>
<p>The aim of the Learning City by bringing together residents and City Leaders to shape the
agenda for new pathways into learning and employment by connecting and amplifying
formal, informal, and in work learning opportunities that exist across the City.</p>
<p>A group of residents formed a Community Panel and shared stories and lived experience
about what learning means to them. The second part of the session was a Hackathon with
the Community using facilitated breakout rooms to discuss a range of themes which were
as follows:</p>

<p>➢ How do we acknowledge lived experience and life skills?</p>

<p>➢ How do we improve routes into formal learning and employment? What are the
barriers?</p>

<p>➢ How do we use learning from Covid to build a better, fairer, healthier, greener
Salford?</p>

<p>➢ How do we engage people in contributing to the Learning City on an ongoing basis</p>

<p>➢ What do people want to learn about and how as a system do, we support that
learning?<p/>

<p> project plan has been developed to shape this work further in 2022 and we want to
develop a platform to connect digitally with organisations and residents through the
development of a Learning City app or webpage.</p>
